 * Cacheable object.
 *
 * This interface can be implemented by any class that is going to be passed into a cache and allows it to take control of the
 * structure and the information about to be cached, as well as how to deal with it when it is retrieved from a cache.
 * Think of it like serialisation and the __sleep and __wakeup methods.
 * This is used because cache stores are responsible for how they interact with data and what they do when storing it. This
 * interface ensures there is always a guaranteed action.

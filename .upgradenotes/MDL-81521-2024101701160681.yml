    - message: >
        A new test-case, `\mod_quiz\tests\attempt_walkthrough_testcase`, has been extracted from the
        `\mod_quiz\attempt_walkthrough_from_csv_test` unit test and should be used instead.

        To support this testcase the existing `$files` instance property should be replaced with a new static method,
        `::get_test_files`. Both the existing instance property and the new static method can co-exist.

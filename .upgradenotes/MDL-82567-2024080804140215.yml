issueNumber: MDL-82567
notes:
  core_table:
    - message: >-
        The `\core_table\dynamic` class declares a new method `::has_capability()` to
        allow classes implementing this interface to perform access checks
        on the dynamic table.

        Note: This is a breaking change. All implementations of the `\core_table\dynamic`
        table interface _must_ implement the new `has_capability(): bool` method for continued
        functionality.
      type: changed

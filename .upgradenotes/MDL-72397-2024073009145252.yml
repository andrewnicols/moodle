notes:
  qbank_managecategories:
    - message: >
        The `\qbank_managecategories\question_category_object` class has been deprecated.

        Methods previously part of this class have been moved to either

         - `\qbank_managecategories\question_categories`,
          for the parts used within this plugin for display a list of categories; or

        `\core_question\category_manager`,
          for the parts used for generate CRUD operations on question categories, including outside of this plugin.

        This change will allow `\qbank_managecategories\question_category_object` to be deprecated, and avoids
        other parts of the system wishing to manipulate question categories from
        having to violate cross-component communication rules.

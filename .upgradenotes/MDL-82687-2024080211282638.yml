  core_form:
    - message:
        The `duration` form field type has been modified to validate that the supplied value is a positive value.

        Previously it could be any numeric value, but every usage of this field in Moodle was
        expecting a positive value. When a negative value was provided and accepted, subtle bugs
        could occur.

        Where a negative duration _is_ allowed, the `allownegative` attribute can be set to `true`.
      type: improved

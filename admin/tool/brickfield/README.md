# Accessibility plugin #

The Accessibility admin tool plugin provides a simple means of checking content for any accessibility issues.

It runs and saves configured accessibility checks, on specified content modules (such as label or page) on specified course IDs.

Accessibility reports can then be generated for analysis.
